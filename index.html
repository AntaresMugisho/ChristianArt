            <h3>Artist statement</h3>
            <p>Thought my artistic creations I want to transmit to the public the problem that we face in society in order to find a solution.
                And I’m also inspired by a great HyperRealistic artist <strong>Arinze stanley </strong> , je said that: &gt;_Most times it’s almost like I lose control of my pencil and the art flows through me to the paper. I work with my principle of the three p’s namely patience, practice and persistence. These have guided me over the years toward perfecting craft.</p>

                <p> Culture: The Venerables, an exhibition in honor of the vulnerable!
                    
                     Seeing the public perplexed and confused, Christian RUKEZA decided to clarify the meaning of their art.
                    
                     “Hyperrealism consists of reproducing an image in such a realistic way that the viewer wonders whether the work produced is a painting or a photograph.  It’s that feeling you get when you don’t believe it, that we live for,” he explains.</p>
